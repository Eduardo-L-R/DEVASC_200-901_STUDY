1.1 Compare data formats (XML, JSON, and YAML)

Q. What are these data formats?
 A. These data formats are structures intended to serialize data for storage and transfer.

The data_structures.py is designed to give you a comparison in code of XML,JSON,and YAML.
If you do not wish to run the script yourself, the most recent output from my computer can be found as data_structures_output.txt

I've attached some excellent reference resources to get a better understanding of each format.  I recommend reading each section.
