# What is waterfall development?

Waterfall is the core workflow used in each of the three development processes.

<b>Waterfall Phases:</b>
1. Requirements Gathering - Understand the requirements of your project.
2. Design - Design solution to meet the requirements.
3. Implementation - Engineering and implementation.
4. Testing - Make sure it all works.
5. Release to Market - Customer, Stakeholder, and Consumer get the product.

<b>Key disadvantages:</b>
1. There has been no feedback during this process from the customer.
2. There has been no feedback during this process from the consumers.

# What is agile development?

Agile development is an iterative approach to a compressed waterfall development process.  Take a look at the new waterfall process we use below.
This time we gear the initial design towards a <b>minimal viable product</b>.

<b>Compressed Waterfall Phases:</b>
1. Requirements Gathering - Understand the requirements of your project.
2. <b>Design - We design for minimal viable product and subsequent iterations we design additional requirements.</b>
3. Implementation - Engineering and implementation.
4. Testing - Make sure it all works.
5. Build and Release + Maintenance - Release the code.

<b>Agile Phases:</b>
1. (Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback
2. (Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback
3. (Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback
4. (Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback
5. Release to Market - Customer, Stakeholder, and Consumer get the product.

<b>Key advantages:</b>
1. We can now solicit feedback from our customer.

<b>Key disadvantages:</b>
1. There is potential for scope creeping.
2. There has been no feedback during this process from the consumers.

# What is lean development?

Lean development is the same iterative approach as Agile with one major exception.  We release our code to market with every compressed waterfall iteration.
<br>

<b>Lean Phases:</b>
1. (Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback + Get Market Feedback
2. (Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback + Get Market Feedback
3. (Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback + Get Market Feedback
4. (Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback + Get Market Feedback
5. (Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback + Get Market Feedback
6. Final Release to Market - Customer, Stakeholder, and Consumer get the product.

<b>Key advantages:</b>
1. The major advantage in lean development is being able to receive market feedback.  This gives us some insight into our product before over committing on our investment.

<b>Key disadvantages:</b>
1. There is potential for scope creeping.
2. Project retention dependent on feedback cycles. More pressure on individual cycles.
