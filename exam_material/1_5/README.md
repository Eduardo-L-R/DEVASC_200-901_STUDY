<b>function</b> - A function is a block of statements that performs a specific task

You can find the module I used at exam_material/example_module/example_module.py. As you navigate the folder structure, pay attention to the &#95;&#95;init&#95;&#95;.py files in each folder to our target.  This file indicates to python that the containing folder is part of a module package. The navigation of the module is based on parent and child relationships.
