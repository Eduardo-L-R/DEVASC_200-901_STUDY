# What is Observer pattern?


<h5>My plan for covering this topic is the same all over the internet.  They stole my idea! Just kidding of course. We'll try to cater this towards networking.</h5>

An observer pattern as a basic description is one-to-many(observable-to-observed) application design pattern. 

Very basic comparable networking example:
1. Think of objects being a hub(observable) and spoke(observer). When you plug your device into the hub, you are physically registering your device to the messages being broadcast by the hub.
</p>

Some very common applications that generally use this design pattern today:
1. Chat programs
3. Social Media Feeds
   
Anytime you(object) are registering to a subscriber list, you are likely using this pattern.

<br>
This is a synchronous pattern.  All Observers get notified at the same time.

There are some over overlapping terms within the industry.  The terms belows are commonly interchanged, but may have subtle differences.
Feel free to ignore the rest of this section.  I think it's important to understand the differences.

Some consider these other models as types of observer models.

Interchanged Terms:
    <br>
    1. Observer Model,Pub-Sub Model,Event and Listener Model
    <br>
    2. Observer, Subscriber, Event Listener
    <br>
    3. Observable, Publisher, Event and Channel



Pub-Sub is a distributed architecture. From Publisher to MQ is generally synchronous.  MQ to subscriber is generally asynchronous message que'ing.
